                <h4>MoMA history</h4>
                <p>
                    MoMA PS1, one of the oldest and largest nonprofit contemporary art institutions in the
                    United States, was founded in 1971 by Alanna Heiss as the Institute for Art and Urban
                    Resources Inc., an organization devoted to organizing exhibitions in underutilized and
                    abandoned spaces across New York City. In 1976, it opened the first major exhibition in its
                    permanent location in Long Island City, Queens, with the seminal Rooms exhibition. An
                    invitation for artists to transform the building’s unique spaces, Rooms established the MoMA
                    PS1 tradition of transforming the building’s spaces into site-specific art that continues
                    today with long-term installations by James Turrell, William Kentridge, Pipilotti Rist,
                    Lawrence Weiner, and others.
                </p>
                <p>For the next 20 years, the building was used as studio, performance, and exhibition space, in
                    support of artists from around the world. After a building-wide renovation, P.S.1
                    Contemporary Art Center (now MoMA PS1) reopened in 1997, confirming its position as the
                    leading contemporary art center in New York. True to the building’s history and form, the
                    renovation preserved much of the original architecture, as well as most of its unique
                    classroom-sized galleries.
                </p>
                <p>In 2000, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center became an affiliate of The Museum of Modern Art to
                    extend the reach of both institutions, and combine MoMA PS1’s contemporary mission with
                    MoMA’s strength as one of the greatest collecting museums of modern art.
                </p>
                <p>A true artistic laboratory, MoMA PS1 aspires to maintain its diverse and innovative
                    activities to continue to bring contemporary art to international audiences.
