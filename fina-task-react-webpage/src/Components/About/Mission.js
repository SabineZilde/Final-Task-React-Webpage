                <h4>MoMA Mission statement</h4>
                <p>Founded in 1929 as an educational institution, The Museum of Modern Art is dedicated to
                    being the foremost museum of modern art in the world.
                </p>
                <p>Through the leadership of its Trustees and staff, The Museum of Modern Art manifests this
                    commitment by establishing, preserving, and documenting a permanent collection of the
                    highest order that reflects the vitality, complexity and unfolding patterns of modern
                    and contemporary art; by presenting exhibitions and educational programs of unparalleled
                    significance; by sustaining a library, archives, and conservation laboratory that are
                    recognized as international centers of research; and by supporting scholarship and
                    publications of preeminent intellectual merit.
                </p>
                <p>Central to The Museum of Modern Art’s mission is the encouragement of an ever-deeper
                    understanding and enjoyment of modern and contemporary art by the diverse local,
                    national, and international audiences that it serves.
                </p>
                <p>To achieve its goals The Museum of Modern Art recognizes:

                    <ul>
                        <li> That modern and contemporary art originated in the exploration of the ideals and
                            interests generated in the new artistic traditions that began in the late nineteenth
                            century and continue today.</li>
                        <li>That modern and contemporary art transcend national boundaries and involve all forms
                            of
                            visual expression, including painting and sculpture, drawings, prints and
                            illustrated
                            books, photography, architecture and design, and film and video, as well as new
                            forms
                            yet to be developed or understood, that reflect and explore the artistic issues of
                            the
                            era.</li>
                        <li>That these forms of visual expression are an open-ended series of arguments and
                            counter
                            arguments that can be explored through exhibitions and installations and are
                            reflected
                            in the Museum’s varied collection.</li>
                        <li>That it is essential to affirm the importance of contemporary art and artists if the
                            Museum is to honor the ideals with which it was founded and to remain vital and
                            engaged
                            with the present.</li>
                        <li>That this commitment to contemporary art enlivens and informs our evolving
                            understanding
                            of the traditions of modern art.</li>
                        <li>That to remain at the forefront of its field, the Museum must have an outstanding
                            professional staff and must periodically reevaluate itself, responding to new ideas
                            and
                            initiatives with insight, imagination, and intelligence. The process of reevaluation
                            is
                            mandated by the Museum’s tradition, which encourages openness and a willingness to
                            evolve and change.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>In sum, The Museum of Modern Art seeks to create a dialogue between the established and
                    the experimental, the past and the present, in an environment that is responsive to the
                    issues of modern and contemporary art, while being accessible to a public that ranges
                    from scholars to young children.</p>
